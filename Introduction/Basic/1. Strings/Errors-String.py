#It is to be noted that anything stored under string becomes a 'Character' even numbers becomes string as shown below!

#For Example

num1 = 8
num2 = 2

print(num1 + num2);
#Output: 10

#Error in Numbers While Using String
num1 = '8'
num2 = '2'
print(num1 + num2);

#Output: 82
#(adding up the two integers and not number!)
